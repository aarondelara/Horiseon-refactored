# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

My motivation for this project was to refactor the code for this website to make it appear cleaner and organized. As a web developer, I prefer to see my code structured nicely and make it easier on my eyes to read everything. The purpose of me refactoring this code was to make it so that there are less lines of code. From my experience, I learned that HTML doesn't allow sections inside of sections but, HTML does allow you to put articles inside of sections.
